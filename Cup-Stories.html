<h2><b><u>1. Am a Cup</u></b></h2>
<p>am a Cup!</p>
<p>You use me to draw water everyday</p>
<p>You use me to drink water everyday</p>
<p>The water that adds your life span passes through me</p>
<p>The pathway of life expectancy</p>
<p>i draw life, carry life, the soul knows</p>
<p>You easily replace me with other new designs to fit the generation</p>
<p>But Iâ€™ll forever remain the same cup</p>
<p>That you knew when you were a kid</p>
<p>It is the design that has only changed</p>
<p>It is the quality that has changed</p>
<p>A cup or a glass of water lol</p>
<p>Just some twisted names</p>
<p>Am still a cup</p>
<p>Oneday you will realize</p>
<p>The ungrateful will be grateful</p> 
<p>No believers will believe</p> 
<p>That all their life</p>
<p>It has been always a cup</p>
<p>Adding your life span.</p>
