<p>A Heart-breaking Story
<p>15th September 2010, was not just another day; it was the day that changed my life forever. I remember seeing her for the first time, sitting quietly on the last bench of our classroom. She was a new addition to our second-year Engineering batch, and there was something about her that took my breath away. She had a warmth to her smile and a light in her eyes that seemed to draw everyone in. I, on the other hand, was the classic nerd at the front of the class, buried in my books with my heart quietly aching for her. I had developed a crush a deep, undeniable crush but the fear of rejection kept me rooted in my seat, too shy to approach her.

<p> As the days rolled on, our exams drew closer, and I found myself tangled in both excitement and dread. After one exam, as I stepped out with a mix of relief and anxiety, I was taken aback when she appeared right in front of me, her face illuminating with a beautiful smile. She told me she was alone for lunch and asked if I could join her to discuss her doubts about the exam. My heart raced as I agreed. That lunch was a turning point filled with laughter, shared worries, and a connection I could hardly believe was happening. That night, I could not sleep; I replayed every moment, feeling like I was floating in a dream.

<p>The next day mirrored the previous one, as she waited for me after my exam. It felt as if the universe was weaving our lives together in an intricate tapestry. Day after day, we shared lunches, and I cherished the gradual closeness that blossomed between us. On the last day of exams, I mustered all my courage to ask for her number, and when she readily provided it, my heart soared. We began exchanging messages, each note forging a deeper bond between us.</p>

<p>However, the euphoria was short-lived. A few days later, I learned the results, and my heart sank for her as I discovered she had flunked two subjects. When she called me, the sound of her tears was heart-wrenching. She confided in me about her struggles and how she had not told her parents yet. At that moment, I wanted nothing more than to support her. It was not just about academics for me; I wanted to help her find her footing because I enjoyed being in her company.</p>

<p>After the college reopened, she took her supplementary exams and came through with flying colours. Her happiness was contagious, and when she thanked me for my support, it filled me with warmth. I jokingly asked for a treat, and to my surprise, she accepted eagerly. That outing marked another beautiful moment in our journey together, filled with smiles and laughter.</p>

<p>As we continued to spend time together, our friendship transitioned into something more profound. We shared our joys, fears, and dreams, and I became increasingly aware of the feelings I had developed for her. My friends noticed my infatuation too, and deep down, I hoped she felt the same. The thought of her consumed me, and being apart from her left an ache in my heart.</p>

<p>When her birthday arrived during our eighth semester, I felt a rush of excitement mingled with nerves. I had saved up enough money to buy her a beautiful top that she had always admired. I planned to confess my feelings that day, my heart beating in anticipation. After a long wait, she finally arrived, and her smile was radiant. But as we settled into a cosy corner of the restaurant and I began to gather my courage, she delivered the news that shattered my heart she was getting engaged.</p>

<p>In that earth-shattering moment, my world flipped upside down. I felt the weight of crushed dreams like stones in my chest. All I could muster was a shaky congratulations as I handed her the present, fighting to keep a brave face while my insides twisted with sorrow. After dropping her home, I found myself in a quiet space, letting the tears flow uncontrollably. I felt I had lost something irreplaceable, something I had held so dearly.</p>

<p>The days that followed blurred together as I avoided college, neglecting her calls and pushing myself further into isolation. I was engulfed by an overwhelming sadness. Finally, she reached out to me at college, her eyes brimming with concern as she asked why I was staying distant. The realization hit me hard I could not keep ignoring her. I had a limited time left before her wedding, and it was essential for me to treasure every moment we had together.</p>

<p>Once classes ended, she came to my house to hand me her wedding invitation. It was a bittersweet moment, but I agreed to attend, knowing it would be difficult. A job offer in another city meant I would have to leave soon after, and I believed that distancing myself would hurt less than witnessing her happily starting a new chapter with someone else. I sent her a message, explaining the job situation. Although she was taken aback at first, it seemed she understood; I wished more than anything that I could have told her everything I felt.</p>

<p>In the new city, I struggled with deep depression. I was haunted by thoughts of her with another man, drowning in a sense of loss so profound that it seeped into every aspect of my life. I stopped caring for myself, withdrew from family and friends, and sunk deeper into a state of sadness. Yet slowly, I began to realize that this did not serve me. With immense effort, I picked myself up, focusing on work and trying to rebuild my life. After two years, I finally adjusted and even found myself moving back to my hometown, hoping for a fresh start.</p>

<p>Just as I thought I was moving on, an unexpected text message appeared from an unknown number. When I discovered it was her reaching out after all this time a surge of emotions ran through me. She wanted to meet and catch up; it had been so long. I hesitated but eventually agreed. I was ready to confront both the feelings that lingered and the life I had carved out since we parted.</p>

<p>As I approached our meeting place that cloudy morning, I felt a mixture of trepidation and hope. Would this encounter bring closure, or would it reopen old wounds? Whatever it turned out to be, I was about to face the reality of all that had happened between us, and I was prepared to embrace it.</p>
