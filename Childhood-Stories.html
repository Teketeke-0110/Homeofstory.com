<h2><b><u>1. When We Were Young</u></b></h2>
<p>When we were young</p>
<p>So young, innocent and energetic</p> 
<p>Not knowing what the future holds</p>
<p>No worries of where to get food</p>
<p>No worries about the economy</p>
<p>No worries about the self-development</p>
<p>When we were young</p>
<p>Playing is all that was in our mind</p>
<p>No worry of who to vote for</p>
<p>No worry about taking a bath</p>
<p>No worry of what to wear</p>
<p>When we were young</p>
<p>We shared what we had with others</p>
<p>Even if we did not know them</p>
<p>When we were young</p>
<p>We travelled together to unknown places</p>
<p>We returned home together safe and sound</p>
<p>When we were young</p> 
<p>We did not know racism</p> 
<p>Everyone was cool like ice</p>
<p>Everything start with a dream and vision.</p>
