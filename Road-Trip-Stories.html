<h2><b><u>1. Kelvin and Trizar</u></b></h2>
<p>Once upon a time in 2019,</p>
<p>In the green city of Zomba</p>
<p>Existed a beautiful and nice couple</p>
<p>Kelvin and Trizar</p>
<p>They planned a road trip to Brantyre city, Malawi</p>
<p>The sun set, morning came</p>
<p>With excitement,</p>
<p>Kelvin twitched on the ignition</p>
<p>The engine pistons hinted TDC and BDC</p>
<p>They started off their journey at 8am CAT in Zomba</p> 
<p>With smiles on their faces,</p>
<p>They looked at each other</p>
<p>At 8:30am they approached Thondwe bakery stop over</p>
<p>A popular trading centre in the district</p>
<p>They stopped by and have some bottles of beers</p>
<p>Kelvin took six bottles of Carlsberg chill,</p>
<p>While Trizar took three shots of Malawi Brandy for quick boost</p> 
<p>She then took a six pack of Hunters Gold</p>
<p>They agreed to proceed their journey</p>
<p>Trizar took over the driving</p>
<p>Kelvin became the DJ</p>
<p>He played Black Coffee drive me crazy</p>
<p>Both singed along to the song joyfully</p> 
<p>At 11:30am CAT,</p>
<p>They were in Blantyre</p>
<p>They proceeded straight to Amaryllis Hotel</p>
<p>And parked their BMW M3 at B2</p>
<p>And jumped into the elevator</p>
<p>Kelvin pressed B4 “destination”</p>
<p>With beautiful scenery view,</p>
<p>They sat at B4 admiring the beauty of Blantyre city</p>
<p>Whilst waiting for the ordered Pizza,</p>
<p>Kelvin kissed Trizar on her beautiful forehead</p> 
<p>They went to B3 to book a room</p> 
<p>And spent a night together</p>	 
<p>Morning came.</p>
