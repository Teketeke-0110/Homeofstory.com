<h2><b><u>1. The Tears of a Bed</u></b></h2>
<p>am a bed!</p>
<p>Where would you have found comfort if I didn’t exist?</p>
<p>i make you feel home when you’re tired</p>
<p>Tired from the trials and tribulations of this earth</p>
<p>The earth that favours had workers</p>
<p>Ironically politicians are also hard workers</p>
<p>Hard workers that prioritize tax</p>
<p>Tax of poor souls goes into the lake</p>
<p>Like a narrow river murmuring down into the lake</p>
<p>To change its colour into sky blue and make it attractive to human fresh</p>
<p>Am still the same bed</p>
<p>That let you sleep on me without giving you pressure like the way your government do</p>
<p>i let you nil down or hold me and talk to the creator of the universe</p>
<p>Have you ever think of me?</p>
<p>Am a bed</p>
<p>My life is like human development</p>
<p>When years pass, you easily replaces me</p>
<p>i understand you’re my master</p>
<p>Am a bed.</p>
