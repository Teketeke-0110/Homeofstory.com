<h2><b><u>1. A Sad Inspirational Love Story</u></b></h2>
<p>A Sad Inspirational Love Story</p>
<p>It all began when I was 6 years old, playing outside on my farm in California.</p>
<p>I met a boy who was just like every other kid teasing me until I chased him and playfully fought back.</p> 
<p>This spark ignited a strong bond, and soon our playful skirmishes turned into cherished moments by the fence, where I shared my secrets and dreams.</p>
<p>He had this wonderful way of listening, making it easy for me to open up about anything.</p>

<p>As we navigated school together, we had our separate circles but always found our way back to each other at home, sharing stories of our day.</p>
<p>He comforted me when my heart was broken and encouraged me to heal, solidifying my feelings of true friendship.</p>
<p>Yet, deep down, I sensed something more profound.</p>

<p>Our friendship continued to flourish through high school and into graduation, but that lingering feeling persisted.</p>
<p>On graduation night, despite our separate prom dates, I yearned to be with him.</p>
<p>After the celebrations, I visited him, longing to express my feelings.</p> 
<p>Instead, we sat together under the stars, discussing our dreams, as I desperately wished to tell him I loved him.</p>

<p>Though fear held me back, I promised myself I would express my feelings one day.</p>
<p>Even during college, my heart ached to tell him, but he always seemed to be with someone else.</p> 
<p>When he received a job offer in New York, I felt both joy for his success and sorrow for our parting.</p>
<p>Watching him leave felt like the end of an era; I cried, wishing I had shared my true feelings.</p>

<p>I focused on my career, eventually becoming a computer analyst, but the void of his absence lingered.</p>
<p>When I received a wedding invitation from him, I felt a mix of joy and sorrow, realizing my chance for romance was lost.</p> 
<p>Attending his wedding, I felt an overwhelming love for him, but I chose to conceal my emotions, wanting him to have his joyous day.</p>
<p>After the wedding, we continued to write to each other, sharing our lives.</p> 
<p>His silence worried me, until I received a note inviting me back to the fence where our story began.</p>
<p>Seeing him again brought joy, but he was hurting from a divorce.</p>
<p>We embraced tightly, and while he shared his struggles, I couldn't find the words to reveal my own feelings.</p>
<p>As he healed, I found myself falling in love with him again.</p>
<p>When it was time for him to leave, saying goodbye filled me with sadness and hope for our future.</p>
<p>He promised to visit whenever he could.</p> 
<p>But as time went on, he missed a few visits, and eventually, a lawyers call brought shocking news.</p>
